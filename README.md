# Module-22-Big-Data Assignment

The assignment on Big Data involved the application of Spark and Parquet using a Python interface. We optimised the query on the large dataset by caching and partitioning the data. As an example, by partitioning, we improved the same query from 0.35 seconds to 0.08 seconds. The code for this assignment can be found in the Jupyter Notebook called [Home_Sales.ipynb](Home_Sales.ipynb)
